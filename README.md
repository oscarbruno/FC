# Fourier Continuation method

This repository contains routines and scripts associated to the Fourier Continuation procedure.

The FC_Data folder contains the Fourier Continuation matrices mentionned in equations (26) and (27) in [1],
which are used to generate the smooth periodic continuations.

The functions in generate_bdry_continuations.m and precomp_fc_data.m are used to generate these matrices.

The script advection_eqn can be run to observe the convergence properties of a FC-based solver, using a
RK4 scheme in time and the FC-based differentiation in space, for the case of a 1D Linear advection equation
with a prescribed Dirichlet boundary condition.

The script wave_eqn can be run to observe the convergence properties of a FC-based solver, using an
AB4 scheme in time and the FC-based differentiation in space, for the case of a 1D second order wave equation
with the possibility to prescribe either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions at each domain boundary.
